"""
The Michaelis–Menten equation models the kinetics of enzymatic reactions as
v = d[P]/dt = Vmax[S]/K_m + [S]
where v is the rate of the reaction converting the substrate, S, to product, P, catalyzed
by the enzyme. Vmax is the maximum rate (when all the enzyme is bound to S) and the
Michaelis constant, K_m, is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is at
half its maximum value.
Plot v against [S] for a reaction with Km = 0:04 M and Vmax = 0:1 Ms􀀀1. Look ahead
to the next section if you want to label the axes.
