"""
Write a program to read in a two-dimensional array of strings into a list of
lists from a file in which the string elements are separated by one or more spaces. The
number of rows, m, and columns, n, may not be known in advance of opening the file.
For example, the text file
A B C D
E F G H
I J K L
should create an object, grid, as
[['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'], ['E', 'F', 'G', 'H'], ['I', 'J', 'K', 'L']]
Read like this, grid contains a list of the arrayâ€™s rows. Once the array has been read in,
write loops to output the columns of the array:
[['A', 'E', 'I'], ['B', 'F', 'J'], ['C', 'G', 'K'], ['D', 'H', 'L']]
Harder: also output all its diagonals read in one direction:
[['A'], ['B', 'E'], ['C', 'F', 'I'], ['D', 'G', 'J'], ['H', 'K'], ['L']]
and the other direction:
[['D'], ['C', 'H'], ['B', 'G', 'L'], ['A', 'F', 'K'], ['E', 'J'], ['I']]
