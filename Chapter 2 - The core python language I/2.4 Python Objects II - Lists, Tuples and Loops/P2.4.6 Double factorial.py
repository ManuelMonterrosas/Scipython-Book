"""
The factorial function, n! = 1 x 2 x 3 x ... x (n - 1) x n is the product of the first n
positive integers and is provided by the math moduleâ€™s factorial method. The double
factorial function, n!!, is the product of the positive odd integers up to and including n
(which must itself be odd).
Write a routine to calculate n!! in Python.
As a bonus exercise, extend the formula to allow for even n as a product of only even numbers
