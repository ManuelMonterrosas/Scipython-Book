"""
The range of a projectile launched at an angle alpha and speed v on flat terrain is
            R = v^2*sin(2*alpha)/g
where g is the acceleration due to gravity, which may be taken to be 9.81 m/s^2 for
Earth. The maximum height attained by the projectile is given by
            H = v^2*sin^2(alpha)/(2*g)
(We neglect air resistance and the curvature and rotation of the Earth.) 
Write a function to calculate and return the range and maximum height of a projectile, 
taking alpha and v as arguments. Test it with the values v = 10 m/s and alpha = 30Â°.
