"""
The value of pi may be approximated by Monte Carlo methods. Consider the
region of the xy-plane bounded by 0 <= x <= 1 and 0 <= y <= 1. By selecting a large
number of random points within this region and counting the proportion of them lying
beneath the function y = sqrt(1-x^2) describing a quarter-circle, one can estimate pi/4, this
being the area bounded by the axes and y(x). Write a program to estimate the value of pi
by this method.
Hint: use Pythonâ€™s random module. The method random.random() generates a
(pseudo-)random number between 0. and 1. See Section 4.5.1 for more information.
